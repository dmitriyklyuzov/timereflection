# Time Reflection Inc

This is a website for the owner of Time Reflection Inc to keep track of her inventory of permium watches to replace an outdated spreadsheet approach.

It is written in PHP without any frameworks. This was done in order to understand PHP better before diving into learning a framework like Yii or Laravel. Although the code is pure PHP, I did follow an MVC pattern to achieve a cleaner, more understandable and maintainable code. You can find the website's models, views, and controllers inside of the /app folder.

The web app uses AJAX for logging in, adding a new listing, and edit in place in combination with AJAX is used to modifying existing listings. AJAX also handles infinite scrolling on the main page. This is done to minimize load times and save resources.
